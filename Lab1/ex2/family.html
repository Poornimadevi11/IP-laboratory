     <center><p style="color:black;font-size:35px;font-style:italic; alignment-baseline:top; font-weight:bold">Family is the first place where I learn how to manage my emotions, interact with others, and communicate. Itâ€™s also the first setting where I learn about consequences, either positive or negative. Parents are responsible for guiding me, providing life lessons that will be remembered for years to come. </p></center><br/>

         <li style="color=black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;alignment-baseline:center">This is my mom and dad and they are my life, love and everything.</li>
          <li style="color=black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;alignment-baseline:center">My parents both are teachers and they are the precious gifts of god for me.</li>
           <li style="color=black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;alignment-baseline:center">My father's name is V.Arumugachamy and My mother's name is A.Umamaheshwari.</li>
            <li style="color=black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;alignment-baseline:center">The love of them is selfless and they give up their happiness for my happiness.</li>
             <li style="color=black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;alignment-baseline:center">I am the only child for them and I have no siblings which means we are a nuclear family.</li>
             <center><p style="color:black;font-size:30px;font-style:italic; alignment-baseline:top; font-weight:bold">Memories are useful to avoid making the same mistakes again. And memories are always carried by families. It is not the books or memory drives but the people living in a family. The mistakes of the past, like a few decades or centuries ago, would be remembered in families.This is what I think about family. </p><center><br/>
